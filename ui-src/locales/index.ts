 * Every locale, imported statically.
 *
 * Static rather than dynamic because the build emits exactly two flat, unhashed
 * files and forbids code splitting (see vite.config.mts), and share.py's
 * _UI_ASSET_KINDS is exactly {fonts, styles, scripts}, so a locales/ asset kind
 * would mean widening the path-traversal guard that serves them. At roughly 5KB
 * gzipped per language that trade is not worth making yet. Revisit past about
 * eight languages.
 *
 * Adding a language is two lines here and one file next to this one. See
 * docs/TRANSLATING.md.
